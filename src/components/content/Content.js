        Hi! My name is Nuanjan, or you can call me Noon. I am a Software
        Engineer (Frontend Focus). I have experience working on HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, React, using public APIs, creating my own APIs and API
        testing. I am a problem solver. I work well under pressure, and I am
        eager to learn the new technologies. I'm excited to continue growing my
        skills. One thing you can count on is the strong work ethic that I will
        bring with me everyday.
